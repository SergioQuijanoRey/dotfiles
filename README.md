- **OS**: `NixOS`
- **WM**: `hyprland` (main) and `i3`
- **Shell**: `nushell` (main), `zsh` and `bash`
- I am using [punto](https://github.com/SergioQuijanoRey/punto) (personal project) to manage this dotfiles
    - In `./punto_configs` you can see how I use this tool
    - Reading that `.toml` files you can install my dotfiles without `punto`, doing some basic `rsync` commands
