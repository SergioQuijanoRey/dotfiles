# Distribution Specific Configurations

- NixOS and Arch linux have different configurations
- So, we have two different sets of `.yaml` files for each one
- For example, package configuration is completely different, but directory hierarchy is almost the same (and thus, `directories.yaml` does not belong to any distro specific config)
